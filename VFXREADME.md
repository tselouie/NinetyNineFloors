### Added Effects

**Camera Sparks** - We've added some sparks to our camera models which acts as an alien-like device to keep track of the player. We've placed a camera in the landing page to show that there have been cameras that have been tampered with by previous challengers, as such the damaged ones will be on the floors with sparks flying out to denote their broken state.

**Dust Particles** - We have dust in the area to show that when the player has been summoned to the initial level there has been a period of time which the level has been dormant. The dust in the air adds a level of realism to immerse the player in the upcoming stages.

**Fog** - Our game will have a lot of mechanics that result in the player's senses to be tested, and fog will be a re-occurring asset that we will use in our later levels as it gives the player a sense of anxiety when exploring the stages. Not knowing what is beyond the fog is a great element of surprise as we intend to hide monsters and traps beyond the fog of war.

**Torch** - Torch with flames were added to level 3 to denote a sense of warmth but at the same time danger as it feels like the player has a breather from the previous levels but is really a transition area to a boss level.

**Sky **- Since the levels in the tower are created with alien technology, real life physics are not in play, so the shape and form of each of the levels always differs. The fact that there is a sky may not mean that the player has left the tower, it is just a false sense of freedom we provide to the player, knowing very well that a mistep can make them fall to their doom.

### Optimizations 

**Dust Particles** - The dust particles are contained near the player to prevent high GPU usage. This optimization aims to help players with loading the level quicker to have a more seamless experience.
