### Added Camera Perspectives

**First-Person** - Added a first-person camera with a larger field of view than that of the third-person view, when transitioning into the first-person view from third-person there is a smooth transition that allows for the user to seamlessly switch from one to another. First person also offers a sense of suspense as the player would not know what is behind them so to keep them on their toes its best to limit the vision of players and create an atmosphere that your back may not be safe.

**Third-Person** - Although not the preferred camera perspective, the third-person allows our players who are used to using controllers and in games utilize third-person a sense of comfort that will enable them succeed as a player.

**Transitions** - Players may solely transition from camera via the scroll button as, the Linear Extrapolation(LERP) feature was added in. Ultimately users would be able to avoid the chopiness associated with camera switching via a button as there is sort of a 'jerk' motion associated with switching each time.
